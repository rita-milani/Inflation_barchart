## Brazilian Inflation Bar Chart Race
Bar Chart Race is a plot that has been very used recently in the media to present the evolution of a variable along time. The most known example is the Covid Bar Chart, with evolution of cases/deaths by country. Since then, many other topics have been portrayed with a Bar Chart Race, from Formula 1 to Super Heroes preferences by the public. Here, I use it to show the evolution of Brazilian inflation since 2021, divided by groups, subgroups and subitems. bar_chart_race library is used.
